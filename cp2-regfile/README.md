# RegFile
## Name: Pedro Mello (pgm15)

## Description of Design
I made it so that the design was as easy to follow as possible, therefore breaking it into as many files as possible, and enjoying the nice consequences of that abstraction and organization. This was pretty much a translation exercise between 250's RegFile in Logisim and Verilog, while adding some extra registers. Most of the necessary structures were given or needed slight modification, i.e. the tri-state buffer that needed to have buses as inputs instead of normal wires.

## Bugs: N/A
